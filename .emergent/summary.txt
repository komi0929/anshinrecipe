<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built the Anshin Recipe application, evolving it from a basic UI to a feature-rich MVP. Key milestones included integrating a dynamic search experience with allergen/context filters, developing a robust end-of-session feedback system, and constructing a comprehensive admin dashboard. A significant part of the work involved wiring the admin dashboard sections (Overview, Context, Quality, Funnel, Extract, Domains) to real or mock MongoDB data, requiring extensive backend logic and frontend rendering. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving by debugging complex routing issues for the admin dashboard, fixing deployment failures due to missing dependencies, and implementing advanced features like Google CSE integration with exponential backoff, explicit error handling, and a Recipe Type Gate to ensure search result quality. The current focus is on meticulously verifying the debug interface for recipe type filtering.

<product_requirements>
The Anshin Recipe application is a mobile-first Japanese recipe search focusing on safety and user preferences, enabling efficient recipe discovery and feedback collection.
**Key Features Implemented:**
1.  **Core UI/UX**: Off-white background, specific fonts, color palette, responsive design. Features allergen picker, context chips, free-text search, and a search button.
2.  **Recipe Display**: Presents up to 10 recipe cards with images, titles, sources, animated AnshinScore gauges, catchphrases, and CTAs. Supports context-tied alternative recipe sets.
3.  **User Feedback**: End-of-session feedback banner (once per day) with options for success, failure, or allergen issues, sending telemetry to the backend.
4.  **Admin Dashboard**: A Basic Auth protected  dashboard with sections:
    *   **Overview**: KPIs (total searches, active users, success rate, CTR, dwell rate) from MongoDB.
    *   **Context**: CTR and feedback shares per context, with performance suggestions.
    *   **Quality**: Stacked daily allergen verdict ratios, latest mismatch reports, dictionary expansion candidates, and daily exclusion reasons chart from MongoDB.
    *   **Funnel**: Conversion rates (search → impression → click → dwell) from real MongoDB data.
    *   **Extract & Domains**: Mock data for parseSource distribution, catchphrase coverage, and top 10 domain metrics.
    *   **Export**: CSV download for events and feedback from real MongoDB data.
5.  **Search Backend**: Integrates Google CSE, enforces production use, implements exponential backoff, explicit 502 error handling for CSE failures (no silent mock fallback), and telemetry. Includes a  endpoint with  status.
6.  **Recipe Type Gate**: Filters search results to include only valid Recipe types (JSON-LD, Microdata, HTML heuristics), excluding non-recipe content. Debug mode () shows  and .
7.  **Rate-Limit & Slow-Path Hardening**: Frontend manages loading states, prevents double submissions via , and displays detailed error UIs with timeout guards (10s delayed, 20s abort). Debug blocks show  and .

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of performing frontend E2E verification for the **Recipe Type Gate** functionality. This involves systematically testing four user-specified queries with  enabled on the main search UI of the Anshin Recipe application. The primary goal is to confirm that the application correctly filters search results to include only items identified as , and that associated debug information such as  (e.g., , ),  (),  (), and  are correctly displayed within the debug blocks below each recipe card.

So far, for this re-verification phase, two out of the four queries have been successfully tested:
1.  **Query 1 (Time-saving context)**: 卵 乳 小麦 なし パンケーキ レシピ
2.  **Query 2 (Beginner context)**: 卵 乳 なし クッキー 簡単 レシピ
Screenshots have been provided for both, confirming that all displayed recipe cards are of  and show accurate debug details.

The engineer is about to initiate testing for **Query 3 (Health context)**: 乳 小麦 なし スープ 高たんぱく レシピ, as indicated by the last message in the trajectory. This query, along with Query 4, had previously faced issues with results loading, which led to the implementation of rate-limit and slow-path hardening. The current task is to re-verify these queries, ensuring the UI never gets stuck and always provides either results or a reasoned error, with complete debug information visible.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue verifying the Recipe Type Gate implementation by running Query #3 (Health context) and Query #4 (Event context) with  and capturing screenshots as per the user's request.
